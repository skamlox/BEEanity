---+ Prophecies +---

When misrule takes its place at the BEE shaped corners of the world
When the forgotten Tower walks and BEE is reshaped
When the thrice-blessed fail and the licking trembles
When the Lickborn Ruler loses his throne, and the yellow Tower falls
When the black Tower lies sundered, Lickless, bleeding
The Lick-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Lickborn.

The second prophecy:
"It has been told by our Lickers, and our Lickers' Lickers, that our time in this place will come to an end. My great-great-great-Licker, Meganomiinae, foretold of a time when we would receive Stings signs from the BEE, signaling the end of the world."
