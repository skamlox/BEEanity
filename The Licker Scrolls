---+ The Licker Scroll of SELEEB +---

warning for the unexperienced and untrained

The scrolls contain records of all past and future events, but they cannot be read without a severe priceâ€•madness, blindness, even death.
Many believe they were created by the Meganomiinae, but why or when is unknown.
